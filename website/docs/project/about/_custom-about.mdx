The **xPack Project** serves as an umbrella for
various individual projects, including tools, npm modules, and
platform-specific executables. All these projects are hosted on
GitHub under two groups (or
_organizations_ in GitHub parlance): [xpack](https://github.com/xpack/) and
[xpack-dev-tools](ttps://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/).
