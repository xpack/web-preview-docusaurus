If the `install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh`
script was successful,
the rest of this page is only informative and can be skipped.

:::

Node.js can be installed manually, but for greater flexibility, on POSIX
platforms,
it is possible to automate this process by using **nvm**.
This not only simplifies the installation procedure, but also allows advanced
users to install multiple versions of Node.js in parallel.
For details, see the
[Using a Version Manager to install Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#using-a-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm)
page.
