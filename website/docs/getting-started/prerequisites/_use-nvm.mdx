The result is an executable named `node`,
which can be used to execute
JavaScript code from a shell, and a symbolic link named `npm` that points to
the `npm-cli.js` script. This script is part of the Node.js module that
provides the `npm` functionality.

:::caution

Some tutorials mistakenly suggest installing Node.js with administrative
rights. While this isn't an issue for Node.js itself, it will require
administrative rights for using `npm` and `xpm`, which can lead to various
permission-related problems. To simplify maintenance, it is highly
recommended to install Node.js and `npm` in the home folder using a
version manager.

If you're confident in what you're doing and prefer a shortcut, copy and
paste the following
[script](https://github.com/xpack/assets/blob/master/scripts/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh)
into a terminal.
Otherwise, follow the steps one by one.

:::caution

For security reasons, conscientious users
should review the content of the file before executing it.

:::

If you trust the script, you can use the following shortcut:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpack/assets/master/scripts/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh | ${SHELL}

export NVM_DIR="${HOME}/.nvm"
source "${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh"
```

Otherwise download and check the script:

```sh
mkdir -pv "${HOME}/Downloads/"
curl --output "${HOME}/Downloads/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpack/assets/master/scripts/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh
cat "${HOME}/Downloads/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh"
```

When confident, run it:

```sh
${SHELL} "${HOME}/Downloads/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh"

exit
```

This script will install `nvm` (the Node Version Manager), `node`,
`npm` and `xpm`.

:::info

To automatically activate `nvm`, the script adds several lines
to the shell initialization script. Therefore, it is necessary
to restart the shell to apply these changes.
