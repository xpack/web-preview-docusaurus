## Mission statement

Our mission: empower developers to efficiently **manage dependencies**
and **multi-configuration builds**.

Based on a simple multi-version dependencies manager
built on top of **npm**,
the xPack Project aims to provide a suite of cross-platform tools.
These tools are designed to manage, **configure**, **build** and **test**
complex,
modular, **multi-target** (multi-architecture, multi-board, multi-toolchain)
projects, in a **reproducible** way, with a particular focus on **C/C++** and
**bare-metal embedded** projects.

Benefits: **Enhanced code sharing and reuse** throughout the lifecycle of
**libraries and applications**, leading to
**greater efficiency and productivity**.
